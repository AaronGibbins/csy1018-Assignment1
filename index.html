        <h2>A little about Aaron Gibbins</h2>
        <p>I'm a student at northampton University, my hobbies include gaming, modding games, reading, climbing and listining to music.</p>
        <p>Before I came to Northampton University to study games development, I took a similar course at Loughborough College that, instead of focusing on the programming aspect, they provided me and my former classmates with a range of different experiences for the games industry, so that we could find what we liked to do.</p>
        <p>I have so far enjoyed working on the Northampton University games development course as I have met people who share the same likes and hobbies as I do.</p>
