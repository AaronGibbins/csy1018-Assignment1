      <h1 class="logo-text">About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Aaron Gibbins.</p>
      <p>I have a couple of hobbies that keep me interested in a range of different subjects, one of which is gaming. people may think this is for entertainment purposes only, but when I decide to play a game, especially on a computer, around 50%-65% of the time I focus on trying to alter the software in some way, to change or add to the original game however I can.</p>
      <p>Because of this 'facination' with altering pre-existing games, I decided to join the game dev course at Northampton University, so that I might one day make a game myself instead of messing around with someone elses. I am new to coding and therefore have very limited experience before coming to Northampton, yet I have still managed to pick up a few things in some of the languages we are taught (mainly Actionscript3). I am lacking in a few social skills, yet I have still managed to get by working with two seperate groups of people successfully, in order to produce and in one case present work we did, which in all honesty is probably one of the hardest parts of coming to University for me.</p>
      <p>To sum up this short insight into who 'Aaron Gibbins is', my passion comes from seeing what can be improved or changed within games or (to a lesser extent) programs, I belive that this can be expanded from basic modding to actual contribution to programming, and I also possess a interest in how the games work i.e. physics and mechanics that have been implemented. a little more detal about me can be found on the CV and Contact pages.</p>
