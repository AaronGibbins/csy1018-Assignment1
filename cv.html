        <h2>CV</h2>
        <p>Name: Aaron James Gibbins</p>
        <p>Address: *************, ********</p>
        <p>Postcode: **** ***</p>
        <p>Phone number: +44 **** ******</p>
        <p>_____________________________________</p>
        <p>I have attended both Woodbrook Vale high school and Rawlins Community College, located near or in loughborough, there I graduated with exeptional grades in computer systems. From there I attended Loughborough College, where I studied Games Development for 2 years and passed with a Merit-Pass-Pass grade. Currently, I am attending my first year of Games Development at Northampton University.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Courswwork that I have done, which is relevant to programming and games development, is as follows: using flow chart diagrams, creating 3D models of characters and environments, animation, coding a door and character with animations and imput device functions(i.e. pressing w = walking forwards) in Unreal Engine, not to mention my end of year college project was to produce a full professional pitch for a game idea.</p>
        <p>My experience in Games Development is what I have completed for my coursework, but I have had experience non the less in how to program code in engines for different games, as well as learning fast how to code using different languages both quickley and effectively.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>As stated in the previous paragraph, I am currently learning a few different programming languages: Actionscript3, Javascript and CSS to name some. Other skills that I possess include prior experience using Game Engines and art software, conducting market and buisness research, and a small amount of knowledge of coding.</p>
        <p>My favourite activity that is related to the course I am studying is playing games, or more accuratly, modifying them to change things within the game world, such as textures and character animations. The reason why I like to do this is because even a minor change applied to a game can change it drastically, plus there is minimal limits to what can be achieved with imagination and an existing world to edit.</p>
